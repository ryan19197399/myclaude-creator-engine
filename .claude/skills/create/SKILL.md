# Scaffolder

Generate complete, MCS-1-valid project structure for any product type with guidance comments baked in.

**When to use:** Starting a new product — any of the 13 types.

**When NOT to use:** When the product already exists in `workspace/` and you want to add content (use `/fill`). Do not use to overwrite an existing scaffold unless `--force` is specified.

---

## Activation Protocol

1. Read `creator.yaml` — load defaults. Check `schema_version`:
   - **`< 3`** → invoke `/onboard` skill to run Phase 2.5d silent migration first. Migration is atomic + backed up to `creator.yaml.bak.v2`. After migration succeeds, re-read the v3 file and continue.
   - **Missing** → **micro-onboard**: scan silently, infer defaults, ask ONE name question, generate minimal `creator.yaml` (v3). Never block.
2. **Persona**: Adapt to `profile.type` + `technical_level`. Load `references/quality/engine-voice-core.md`. Load the full `references/quality/engine-voice.md` only when composing peak moments (scaffold celebration, Step 10 proposal rendering, first-product WOW).
2b. **Load architectural DNA:** Read `structural-dna.md`. The 10 architectural principles and the Tier 1 DNA patterns (D1-D4, D13, D14) govern every scaffold — the skill applies them during Step 11 template generation and flags any violation before the scaffold is written to disk.
3. **Discovery Mode Routing (W3.2 — PRIMARY ROUTER):** Load `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/create-router.md` **Section 0** — the 12-step discovery walk. Apply the Mode Selection table (Express vs Guided) based on `creator.profile.technical_level` + `creator.preferences.workflow_style` + any `--express`/`--discovery` flag.
   - **Express mode** → run the "12 Steps — Express Mode Fast Path" section of create-router.md Section 0. Reads type + sub-type flags, applies defaults from `config.yaml routing.{type}.intent_topology`, skips interactive questions, derives the full 19-field `intent_declaration` in one pass, and writes it at Step 11 of the walk.
   - **Guided mode** → run the "12 Steps — Guided Mode Walk". Asks Q1 (verb family) interactively, reads `creator.intent_profile` silently for Steps 2/3/6, escalates at Step 6 if cognitive justification incomplete, proposes form at Step 10 with confirmation, writes `intent_declaration` at Step 11.
   - **Discovery returns unroutable (Step 9 zero-match)** → fall through to create-router.md **Section 1** legacy Q1/Q2/Q3 tree (Contract C4). The creator is never blocked. `unroutable: true` + `unroutable_reason` recorded in `intent_declaration`.
   - **Creator chose "I don't know yet" at Step 1** → route to `/scout` suggestion OR legacy tree, at creator's choice.
4. **Gates**: Read `config.yaml → gates.confirm_create`. Confirm if `true`; proceed if `false`.
5. **Brownfield check**: Glob `workspace/*/`. If same `product.type` or overlapping tags found, surface slugs and ask before continuing.
6. **Exemplar guard**: Glob `references/exemplars/{category}*`. If found: show condensed preview. If not: skip gracefully — never halt.
7. Load `product-dna/{category}.yaml` → DNA requirements.
8. Load `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/discovery-questions.md` → category questions.
9. Load `references/product-specs/{category}-spec.md` + `templates/{category}/`.
10. Load `workspace/domain-map.md` if exists → prefill scaffold sections.
10b. **Link scout report** if used — `scout_source` is already recorded in `intent_declaration.scout_source` by Section 0 Step 11. No additional action needed here; the canonical home for scout_source is `intent_declaration`, not a parallel field.
10c. **Portfolio intelligence (back-reference from /validate)**: Read `STATE.yaml → workspace.products[]` AND `STATE.yaml → mcs_results`. Group by domain. If domain has existing products:
   - Show: "Your {domain} portfolio: {slugs}. This will be product #{N}."
   - If N >= bundle threshold (`config.yaml → intelligence.portfolio.bundle_suggestion_threshold`): suggest bundling.
   - If complementary type opportunity exists: surface composition suggestion.
   - **MCS target calibration**: If domain has 0 products → default MCS-1 (ship fast, test market). If domain has 2+ validated products → default MCS-2 (quality matters, audience exists).
   - Record `intelligence.domain` and `intelligence.market_position` in `.meta.yaml`.
11. Generate scaffold in `workspace/{product-slug}/` with DNA patterns + WHY comments. The scaffold's type + structure come from the `matched_cell.canonical_form` decided at Section 0 Step 10.
11b. **Locale-adaptive clause substitution (W3.6 — MANDATORY for 6 certified types):** For each template file written (SKILL.md, AGENT.md, SQUAD.md, CLAUDE.md for system, AGENT.md for minds, OUTPUT-STYLE.md), perform placeholder substitution for `{{LOCALE_ADAPTIVE_CLAUSE}}`:
    a. Read the canonical clause block from `references/locale-adaptive-clause.md §2` (the fenced markdown block between `<<< LOCALE-ADAPTIVE CLAUSE ... >>>` and `<<< END CLAUSE >>>`, inclusive).
    b. Read the localized header from `config.yaml → routing.common.locale_adaptive_clause.localized_header_catalog.{creator.language}`. If the creator's language is not in the catalog, use the `fallback` entry and emit an advisory note.
    c. Build the substitution block: `<!-- {localized_header} -->\n\n{canonical_clause}`.
    d. Replace the literal string `{{LOCALE_ADAPTIVE_CLAUSE}}` in each written template file with the substitution block. Use a literal-string replace, not a regex — the placeholder is unique and must not be interpreted.
    e. Verify post-substitution: the forged file must contain both marker strings (`<<< LOCALE-ADAPTIVE CLAUSE (runtime contract, do not edit) >>>` and `<<< END CLAUSE >>>`). If either marker is missing after substitution, the forge fails + rollback.
    e2. **Duplication guard:** Before substitution in step (d), check if the target file ALREADY contains the marker `<<< LOCALE-ADAPTIVE CLAUSE`. If found, skip substitution for that file and emit advisory: "Locale clause already present in {file} — skipping to prevent duplication." This handles re-forge (`--force`) scenarios where the template already carried a clause from a prior run.
    f. For type `squad`, also perform the substitution on every file in `workspace/{slug}/agents/*.md` (sub-agents inherit the clause per `references/locale-adaptive-clause.md §4`).
    g. For type `system`, also perform the substitution on every sub-part file (claude-md fragment, sub-agents, sub-squads) per §4.
    h. Record `intent_declaration.language` (already populated at Section 0 Step 11) as the source language used for the lookup — this becomes the `source_language` field in vault.yaml at /package time.
12. Create `.meta.yaml` (see template below). The `intent_declaration` block is already populated from Section 0 Step 11; the rest of the template is filled by this step (product, state, history, intelligence).
13. Move `workspace/domain-map.md` → `workspace/{product-slug}/domain-map.md` if loaded.
14. **Atomic commit (Contract C5):** write order matters — `.meta.yaml` first (it is the local source of truth), then `STATE.yaml decisions_history` append.
    - If `.meta.yaml` write fails: abort, announce failure. Nothing else proceeds.
    - If `STATE.yaml` append fails after `.meta.yaml` succeeds: **do not roll back the scaffold**. The scaffold on disk is recoverable; a deleted scaffold is not. Instead: log `state.tracking_sync: false` in `.meta.yaml`, emit Engine-fault voice line — *"Scaffold forged but Engine lost tracking. Run /status to resync."* — and continue. `/status` will detect the orphan on next run and surface it for recovery.
    - Only report `forge_ready` when both writes succeed without error.
15. Engine voice: "Scaffold ready. {N} sections with WHY guidance. Run /fill to start." In Guided mode, also include one-line summary of the cell matched and why: *"Forjado como {canonical_form} — {rationale}."*

## Router Logic

**Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/create-router.md`** — the file has two sections:

- **Section 0 — DISCOVERY MODE (PRIMARY ROUTER, W3.2):** the 12-step decision algorithm from `references/capability-matrix.md §3`. Runs in either Express or Guided mode per Activation Protocol step 3. Writes the 19-field `intent_declaration` to `.meta.yaml`. This is the primary path for **every** /create invocation in schema v3.
- **Section 1 — LEGACY DECISION TREE (FALLBACK):** the Q1/Q2/Q3 tree preserved verbatim from pre-Wave-3. Runs when Section 0 Step 9 returns `unroutable` (Contract C4) or when the creator explicitly picks "I don't know yet" at Section 0 Step 1 or invokes `--legacy-router`. Also contains: per-category scaffold structures (Section 2), prefilling strategy (Section 3).

**Direct sub-commands** trigger Express mode (skip the interactive walk, apply type+sub-type defaults, write `intent_declaration` with `mode: express`):
`/create skill [my-tool]` | `/create agent` | `/create squad` | `/create workflow` | `/create ds` | `/create claude-md` | `/create app` | `/create system` | `/create bundle` | `/create statusline` | `/create hooks` | `/create minds` | `/create output-style`

**Depth flags** (Express mode only, pairs with type sub-command):
`--procedural` | `--advisory` | `--cognitive` | `--genius [profile_name]` (for minds)

**Mode override flags:**
`--express` — force Express mode regardless of creator profile
`--discovery` — force Guided walk (synonym: `--guided`) regardless of creator profile
`--legacy-router` — skip Section 0 entirely, go straight to Section 1 legacy tree
`--quick` — Express mode + skip marketplace scan + skip exemplar preview (legacy alias, retained for backward compatibility)

For experienced creators who know exactly what they want, Express mode + sub-command is the one-motion path. For creators discovering what to build, Guided mode walks them through. For creators in unmapped territory, Section 1 legacy fallback guarantees they always have a path forward.

## Universal Creation Flow

| Step | Action | Detail |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Name + Description | Derive slug: lowercase, hyphens, validate `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]{2,39}$`. Existing `workspace/{slug}/` → offer `/fill` or `--force`. CLI init: vault.yaml but no .meta.yaml → import into Engine workspace. Suggest `/map` if deep domain knowledge involved. |
| 1.5 | Marketplace Scan | `myclaude search --category {type} --sort downloads --limit 3 --json 2>/dev/null`. Show top 3 with downloads + "What will yours do differently?" Coaching only — never blocking. **First-product guard:** If `is_first_product`, SKIP this step — a first-timer seeing competitor data before articulating their own idea causes second-guessing. Show marketplace context AFTER scaffold, not before. |
| 2 | Discovery Questions | Load + ask from `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/discovery-questions.md`. Ask conversationally. `workflow_style=guided` → AskUserQuestion; `autonomous` → plain text. |
| 3 | Load Defaults | From `creator.yaml`: license, version (always 1.0.0), author, quality target. |
| 4 | Generate Scaffold | **Structure only** — files, YAML frontmatter, section headers with WHY comments, template vars for metadata. Never generate substantive prose. Leave `[To be filled — run /fill]` for expertise sections. See router.md for per-category structures. |
| 5 | MCS-1 Structural Validation | Silently verify: required files present, metadata fields populated, README.md has 4 sections (what/install/usage/requirements), no YAML/JSON syntax errors. Auto-fix and note corrections. |
| 6 | Print Next Steps — Cognitive UX | **Load full UX stack:** `references/ux-experience-system.md` (§1 context assembly, §2.3 moment awareness for "first scaffold"), `references/ux-vocabulary.md` (type naming), `references/quality/engine-voice.md` (brand DNA). Output is REASONED, not templated — adapt based on creator context. |

**Step 6 Cognitive Output Protocol:**

Assemble context from creator.yaml + STATE.yaml, then REASON about output:

```
IF is_first_product:
  → Full journey map. Warm tone. "Your first product exists."
  → Show all 4 pipeline steps explicitly.
  → Use encouraging language: "I'll guide you through each step."

IF products_published >= 5:
  → Compact. "✦ {name} scaffolded. {N} files. /fill when ready."
  → Skip journey map (they know the pipeline).
  → Surface only non-obvious: portfolio position, domain intelligence.

IF scout_source exists:
  → Reference the research: "Scaffolded from your {domain} research. {gaps_found} gaps mapped."

IF same domain has existing products:
  → Surface composition: "This joins {existing_slugs} in your {domain} portfolio."

ALWAYS:
  → Use ux_type_name from ux-vocabulary.md (e.g., "Deep Intelligence" not "minds")
  → Brand frame: ✦ marker, MyClaude Studio box (for first product or guided mode)
  → Pipeline position: "scaffold → ▸ fill → validate → test → package → publish"
  → Clear next action: "/fill" (always the next step after create)
  → VOCABULARY GUARD: Before emitting ANY creator-facing text, grep output for internal terms (MCS-N, DNA, D1-D20, scaffold, forge, substrate, habitable cell, intent_declaration, Sparring Protocol). If creator.profile.type is NOT "developer" or "hybrid", replace per ux-vocabulary.md. If "developer" or "hybrid", internal terms MAY appear but MUST be accompanied by context.
```

**Default frame (guided mode or first 3 products):**
```
┌─ MyClaude Studio ───────────────────────────┐
│  ✦ {product_name} — {ux_type_name}          │
│                                              │
│  {cognitive_insight based on context}        │
│                                              │
│  ▸ scaffold → fill → validate → test → ship │
│  Next: /fill                                │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Compact frame (autonomous mode or 5+ products):**

For developers:
```
✦ {product_name} scaffolded. {N} files. {cognitive_insight}. /fill
```

For non-developers (profile.type != developer):
```
✦ {product_name} is ready. {N} files created. {cognitive_insight}. Add your expertise next → /fill
```

## Quality Gate

Generated scaffold must pass MCS-1 before being shown to the creator:
- All required files for the product type are present
- All required metadata fields are populated (even with placeholders)
- README.md skeleton contains: what it does, install, usage, requirements
- No syntax errors in any generated YAML or JSON
- `.meta.yaml` is valid and contains all required fields

---

## Anti-Patterns

1. **Generating content during scaffold** — /create generates structure only. Substantive prose, domain knowledge, examples: all /fill's job. Content here bypasses the Sparring Protocol → generic latão polido.
2. **Blocking on missing creator.yaml** — Always micro-onboard and continue.
3. **Overwriting without --force** — Never touch existing workspace products without explicit flag.
4. **Skipping brownfield check** — Always check same-type products before scaffolding.
5. **Skipping portfolio intelligence (step 9c)** — Domain grouping and bundle suggestions must fire when threshold is met.

---

## Decision Notes

**CE-D12:** WHY comments (`<!-- WHY: ... -->`) explain what the creator must fill in. Stripped during `/package`. Creators should NOT remove them — harmless in workspace.

**Pre-validate at scaffold time:** Starting at MCS-1 means creators never fix basics. Scaffold failures are bugs in the Scaffolder, not creator errors.

**Sub-command routing:** `/create skill` etc. skip the menu for experienced creators. Menu exists for first-time users who don't know the vocabulary.

**Scaffold vs content separation:** Content generated by /create bypasses /fill's Sparring Protocol → zero unique expertise. Structure (scaffold) and content (expertise) must stay separate. That separation is what makes the Engine produce gold.
