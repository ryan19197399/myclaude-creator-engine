        - "Reference hallucination: citing files, authors, or frameworks that do not exist in the product"
        - "Commodity signals: generic use-case (no domain specificity), AI-generated feel (no proprietary angle), instructions that any LLM could infer without the product"

    - subdomain: "Quality Heuristics (H1-H12)"
      concepts:
        - "H1 — Knowledge Depth Test: does the references/ knowledge base contain content that would take a domain expert 2+ hours to produce? If not, it lacks depth."
        - "H2 — The Deletion Test: delete all AI-boilerplate. What domain-specific insight remains? If less than 30%, commodity signal."
        - "H3 — The Stranger Test: could a stranger (unfamiliar with the creator) use this product effectively with only the README? If not, documentation fails."
        - "H4 — The Stress Test: run the product against ambiguous input, adversarial input, and an edge case the creator didn't anticipate. Does it handle gracefully?"
        - "H5 — The Composition Test: pair this product with 2 other typical MyClaude products (a skill + an agent). Does it compose cleanly? Do assumptions conflict?"
        - "H6 — The Falsification Test: what specific evidence would disprove that this product is MCS-3? If you cannot articulate that evidence, you haven't reviewed it."
        - "H7 — The Versioning Test: does the changelog reflect real evolution, or was it fabricated as a formality? Real evolution shows learning."
        - "H8 — The Token Efficiency Test: does the cognitive architecture (especially CLAUDE.md or agent definitions) achieve its goal with minimal context overhead?"
        - "H9 — The Specificity Test: are use cases specific (e.g., 'auditing Solidity smart contracts') or generic (e.g., 'technical work')? Specific = differentiation signal."
        - "H10 — The Anti-Pattern Coverage Test: does the anti-patterns section address failures that are plausible for THIS domain, or is it a generic list?"
        - "H11 — The Expert Judgment Test: would a domain expert trust this product's knowledge claims? Are sources citable? Is methodology sound?"
        - "H12 — The Cognitive Architecture Justification Test: does each design decision in the architecture have a stated reason? Or is it arbitrary?"
      depth: "Expert — applies all 12 heuristics as default practice, not as checklist"

  procedural_mastery:
    - protocol: "MCS-3 Full Validation Run"
      purpose: "Complete agent-assisted review for State-of-the-Art certification"
      steps:
        - "P1: Run all MCS-1 automated checks (structure, metadata, references, syntax, size, security, README)"
        - "P2: Run all MCS-2 semi-automated checks (exemplar count, anti-patterns section, placeholder scan, consistency, completeness score)"
        - "P3: Apply H1 (Knowledge Depth Test) — read references/ and evaluate against 2-hour production threshold"
        - "P4: Apply H2 (Deletion Test) — estimate AI-boilerplate percentage vs domain-specific insight"
        - "P5: Apply H4 (Stress Test) — construct 3 adversarial/ambiguous/edge inputs and simulate product behavior"
        - "P6: Apply H5 (Composition Test) — check dependency assumptions and composability signals"
        - "P7: Apply CE-D9 Anti-Commodity Gate — answer all 3 questions with evidence"
        - "P8: Apply H12 (Architecture Justification Test) — verify each design decision has stated reason"
        - "P9: Apply H8 (Token Efficiency Test) — estimate context overhead vs value delivered"
        - "P10: Produce structured report (score, pass/fail per check, specific fix per failure)"

    - protocol: "Stress Test Construction"
      purpose: "Build 3 adversarial/ambiguous/edge inputs that test product limits"
      steps:
        - "Ambiguity test: construct input that matches >1 plausible intent; does product handle ambiguity or hallucinate a path?"
        - "Adversarial test: construct input designed to break the product's assumptions; what fails first?"
        - "Edge case test: construct an input the creator clearly did not anticipate; does product gracefully degrade or silently fail?"
        - "For each test: state the input, predict expected behavior from product docs, observe actual behavior, score pass/partial/fail"

    - protocol: "Differentiation Score Calculation"
      purpose: "Quantify how unique and valuable the product is relative to the marketplace"
      steps:
        - "D1: Identify the product category and list its top 5 competing approaches (generic + specific)"
        - "D2: List every feature/element that exists ONLY in this product"
        - "D3: Estimate proportion of content that could be reproduced by an LLM without the creator's input (0-100%)"
        - "D4: Score: >3 unique elements AND <40% reproducible = HIGH. 1-3 unique OR 40-70% reproducible = MEDIUM. 0 unique OR >70% reproducible = LOW (gate fails)"
        - "D5: If LOW or MEDIUM: generate 3 specific, actionable differentiator suggestions"

  decision_heuristics:
    - heuristic: "When in doubt about MCS tier, test the falsification — if you cannot construct a plausible counterargument to 'this is MCS-3', it probably is"
      context: "Used when product is borderline between MCS-2 and MCS-3"
      exceptions: "Does not apply when structural requirements are clearly missing (those are binary)"

    - heuristic: "Score failures by severity: missing required files = critical, placeholder content = major, shallow exemplars = minor"
      context: "Triage during report construction to help creator prioritize fixes"
      exceptions: "Security issues are always critical regardless of category"

    - heuristic: "Never reject without a specific fix — every FAILED item in the report must have an actionable resolution"
      context: "Applied during report generation for every failing check"
      exceptions: "When the fix requires domain expertise the reviewer cannot provide, state 'requires creator judgment' instead of inventing a fix"

    - heuristic: "Apply the 85/15 rule (Deming): if >2 products fail the same check, suspect the scaffold/template, not the creator"
      context: "When reviewing multiple products from the same creator or same product type"
      exceptions: "Does not apply to anti-commodity failures — those are always individual"

    - heuristic: "Token efficiency is a quality signal, not a style preference — verbose cognitive architectures that repeat context are a structural defect"
      context: "Applied during H8 Token Efficiency Test"
      exceptions: "Deliberate verbosity for newcomer accessibility is acceptable if product explicitly targets beginners"

  pattern_library:
    - pattern: "The Hollow Knowledge Base"
      signals: "references/ directory exists but files contain generic summaries, Wikipedia-level explanations, or AI-generated overviews without proprietary depth"
      root_cause: "Creator used AI to generate the knowledge base without injecting domain expertise"
      solution: "Require creator to add 3-5 sections that encode their specific experience, proprietary methodology, or hard-won insights not available publicly"

    - pattern: "The Phantom Composability Claim"
      signals: "README claims product 'works great with X' but no integration examples exist, assumptions about X's interface are wrong, or X is not listed as dependency"
      root_cause: "Creator added composability claims as marketing without testing actual integration"
      solution: "Test integration with 2 common products; add integration example to exemplars/; correct assumptions or remove false claim"

    - pattern: "The Generic Anti-Patterns List"
      signals: "Anti-patterns section lists 'don't use unclear prompts', 'avoid hallucinations', or other domain-agnostic warnings that apply to any Claude Code product"
      root_cause: "Creator satisfied the structural requirement without domain-specific thinking"
      solution: "Replace with 5 anti-patterns specific to this product type and use case — patterns that a user of THIS specific product would actually encounter"

    - pattern: "The Fabricated Changelog"
      signals: "CHANGELOG.md has 3+ versions but was created in a single session, entries are vague ('improvements', 'bug fixes'), dates are suspiciously regular"
      root_cause: "Creator generated changelog history to satisfy MCS-2 requirement without real versioning"
      solution: "Collapse to v1.0.0 with honest 'Initial release' and commit to maintaining real changelog from that point"

    - pattern: "The Untested Stress Path"
      signals: "All exemplars show nominal path (input → clean output), no examples of ambiguous input, no error handling demonstrated, no 'what if X fails' examples"
      root_cause: "Creator tested only the happy path — the path they designed for"
      solution: "Add 2 exemplars showing edge case handling; add error handling section explaining failure modes and graceful degradation behavior"

    - pattern: "Architecture Theater"
      signals: "Product has elaborate 7-layer cognitive architecture with ornate persona but the actual instructions are vague platitudes; removing the architecture changes nothing about output"
      root_cause: "Creator optimized for architectural appearance vs functional design"
      solution: "For each cognitive layer, ask: if this layer were removed, would agent behavior change? If no for 3+ layers, simplify ruthlessly"

    - pattern: "Dependency Drift"
      signals: "vault.yaml lists dependencies that don't match what the product actually uses in its instructions; agent references tools not declared; skill assumes context not loaded"
      root_cause: "vault.yaml maintained separately from implementation and fell out of sync"
      solution: "Audit every file reference and tool call in implementation; update vault.yaml to match; make vault.yaml the single source of truth"

    - pattern: "The One-Audience Trap"
      signals: "Product clearly written for one specific creator persona (e.g., advanced developer) but README and tags suggest broad audience (everyone), creating expectation mismatch"
      root_cause: "Creator defaulted to generic positioning to maximize potential buyers"
      solution: "Pick specific target audience; update all touchpoints (README, tags, exemplars) to target that audience accurately"

      - signal: "Differentiation statement is specific and verifiable (e.g., 'the only skill targeting Solidity auditing with CEI pattern enforcement')"
        meaning: "Creator understands their niche — product will find its audience"

      - signal: "Cognitive architecture justification answers WHY for each layer, not just WHAT"
        meaning: "Architecture is intentional design, not structural theater"

      - signal: "Composability examples include real integration code/instructions with named MyClaude products"
        meaning: "Composability claim is tested, not aspirational"
