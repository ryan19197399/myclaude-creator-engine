# Content Filler

Extract domain expertise from creator conversation and inject into product files.

**When to use:** After /create has generated a scaffold. Product state should be "scaffold" or "content".

**When NOT to use:** If the product doesn't exist yet (use /create first). If the product is already validated (edits will regress state).

## Activation Protocol

1. Identify target product:
   - If `$ARGUMENTS` provided, use as product slug → look in `workspace/{slug}/`
   - If `workspace/{slug}/` does not exist → "Product `{slug}` not found in workspace/. Run `/create` first or check `workspace/` for available slugs."
   - If not, glob `workspace/*/` and list products in scaffold/content state
   - If no products in scaffold/content state found → "No products ready to fill. Run `/create {type}` to scaffold one first."
   - If multiple products found, ask which one to fill
1b. **Mode selection (Express vs Guided).** Read `creator.yaml → preferences.workflow_style`. Resolve the flow mode:
    - `--express` flag OR `workflow_style == "autonomous"` → **Express mode**. Skip the three Discovery front-loaded questions, skip the Pitfall Check interactive prompt, skip Extraction Mode menu (default to Standard), skip the Deepening menu after each section, run the section walker with type defaults, and fall straight through to Completion. Interactive prompts are replaced by type-based defaults + one-line advisory notes. Proactive brainstorm prompts are suppressed.
    - `workflow_style == "guided"` or missing → **Guided mode** (default). Run the full protocol as documented in fill-protocol.md.
    Record `fill_config.mode: express | guided` in `.meta.yaml` so later skills can reason about the creator's chosen rhythm.
2. Read `.meta.yaml` from product directory → get type, state, mcs_target, AND the `intent_declaration` block if present.
   - **Intent-aware calibration:** If `intent_declaration` is present, extract `engine_parsed.{depth, nature, delivery_mechanism}`. These three fields drive section walker routing, tone calibration, and question shape — see `fill-protocol.md → INTENT-AWARE CALIBRATION` for the full rubric. Record `fill_config.intent_aware: true` in `.meta.yaml` when the calibration fires.
   - **Legacy fallback:** If `intent_declaration` is absent (legacy product) OR if `intent_declaration.mode == legacy_fallback` with all engine_parsed fields null, fall back to type-based defaults. Emit one advisory line: *"This product lacks intent metadata — /fill will use type-based defaults. Re-run /create to unlock intent-aware filling."* Record `fill_config.intent_aware: false`.
3. **Maintain creator persona**: Read `creator.yaml` → adapt language, depth, and examples to `profile.type` and `technical_level` throughout this skill's execution. A developer gets code examples; a domain expert gets plain language.
4. **Load UX stack (in order)**:
   - `references/quality/engine-voice-core.md` — the micro voice contract carried through every question, section signal, and sparring line in /fill. This is where the Creator spends the most time; the voice cannot drift.
   - `references/ux-experience-system.md` §1 Context Assembly (build creator context), §2.2 Archetype-Aware Insights (adapt emphasis to creator goals), §2.3 Moment Awareness (mid-fill coaching)
   - `references/ux-vocabulary.md` — translate terms in any creator-facing output
   - `references/quality/engine-voice.md` — full voice substrate. Load when composing section quality signals, sparring pressure, milestone celebrations, or brand moments.
   /fill is where the creator spends the MOST time. The experience must be warm coaching, not interrogation. Adapt: beginners get encouragement + examples. Experts get peer-level sparring. Celebrate section completions with progress visibility ("4/7 sections filled. Core identity locked in."). Hyper-personalize using creator.yaml fields — name, goals, expertise areas.
5. Load product spec from `references/product-specs/{type}-spec.md`
6. Load product DNA from `product-dna/{type}.yaml`
7. Load `domain-map.md` if it exists (from /map) → use as knowledge source
8. **Load scout report** if `.meta.yaml` has `scout_source` field → read `workspace/{scout_source}` for research context. Extract: baseline (Section 1), gaps (Section 2), research findings (Section 4). This intelligence drives research injection in the section walk.
8b. **Domain intelligence back-reference:** Read `STATE.yaml → workspace.products[]`. Find products in the same `intelligence.domain` as the current product. If any exist with `intelligence.value_score` populated:
    - Read the most recent sibling's `.meta.yaml → intelligence` and `state.overall_score`
    - If sibling substance_score < 50: "Your last product in {domain} scored {substance}% substance. Focus on depth and real examples this time."
    - If sibling substance_score >= 70: "Your {domain} products have strong substance ({substance}%). Maintain this depth."
    - This closes the feed-back loop: /validate's output informs /fill's approach.
9. Scan product files for template placeholders and WHY comments
10. **Intelligence gap check:** If `.meta.yaml` has NO `scout_source` AND product targets MCS-2+:
    - Show: "No scout report found. Without baseline intelligence, /fill works in creator-knowledge-only mode — no research proposals, no baseline comparison."
    - Suggest: "Run `/scout {inferred_domain}` first for research-backed filling. Or continue with your expertise."
    - Record `fill_config.scout_available: false` in .meta.yaml
    - If creator continues without scout, skip research injection steps in section walker
11. **Structured input for choices**: If `creator.yaml → preferences.workflow_style = guided`, use `AskUserQuestion` for all choice points (enhance/replace/skip, deepening method selection, continue/save progress). Use plain text only for open-ended domain knowledge extraction.
12. **Read fill-protocol.md**: Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/fill-protocol.md` now — it contains the full execution protocol for all phases below.
12b. **SELF-CLONE branch (cognitive minds with sub_type=self only).**
    If `.meta.yaml.type == "minds" AND .meta.yaml.minds_sub_type == "self"`:
    - Load the SELF-CLONE content pack: Read `references/fill-content-packs/self-clone.md`
    - The content pack replaces the standard Discovery, Extraction Mode, and generic Section Walk phases
    - Follow the content pack's walker entry point (§1) which handles:
      - Mode selection (distillation vs elicitation based on corpus density)
      - Distillation pass (if applicable) with creator confirm/refine/reject per entry
      - Gap elicitation with the ordered question sequences per dimension
      - Dimensional routing (primary + secondary tagging)
      - Typology mirror (post-elicitation, three-step protocol)
      - Coherence diff generation
      - Honesty floor gates (counter-proofs, signed incaptable list, uncapturable decisions)
      - Writing populated content into the cognitive mind layer files
    - After the SELF-CLONE walker completes, skip to Completion (step 13 standard flow is bypassed)
    - The Sparring, Checkpointing, and Progress phases from the standard flow still apply during the walker — checkpoint after every two dimensions
    - Record `fill_config.self_clone: true` in `.meta.yaml`
    - **Do not run this branch for non-SELF cognitive minds or non-minds products** — all other types continue to step 13 unchanged
13. Begin section-by-section guided extraction (see fill-protocol.md → DISCOVERY PHASE)

## Core Flow (routing table — details in fill-protocol.md)

| Phase | What happens | Protocol section |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| Discovery | 3 front-loaded questions (audience, differentiator, use case) | DISCOVERY PHASE |
| Acceptance Criteria | Define 3 machine-verifiable criteria before section walk | ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA CAPTURE |
| Extraction Mode | Select mode (Standard/Socratic/Adversarial/Archaeological/Council) for MCS-2+ | EXTRACTION MODE SELECTION |
| Pitfall Check | Load meta/pitfalls/pitfalls.json, surface type-relevant warnings | PITFALL CHECK |
| Type Coaching | Platform-specific coaching (claude-md, minds, hooks, skill/agent, system/bundle) | TYPE-SPECIFIC COACHING |
| Section Walk | Per-section: read WHY, check existing, inject research, ask, write, quality signal | SECTION WALKER |
| Sparring | 3 challenges per major section (Generic Test, Inversion, Proof) — mandatory MCS-2+ | SPARRING PROTOCOL |
| Deepening | 5 elicitation methods offered as optional menu after each major section | ELICITATION DEEPENING |
| Checkpointing | Write fill_progress to .meta.yaml after every section (compact-safe) | MID-FILL STATE PERSISTENCE |
| Progress | Pulse every 2-3 sections: filled/total + live MCS estimate | PROGRESS TRACKER |
| Conversational | Narrative extraction mode for non-dev creators | CONVERSATIONAL MODE |
| Size Check | Auto-split primary file if >4K chars; suggest @include for claude-md | INSTRUCTION SIZE OPTIMIZATION |
| Completion | Promote to content, auto-validate MCS-1, persona-aware message, clear fill_progress | AFTER ALL SECTIONS FILLED |

## Quality Gate

Before promoting to "content" state:
- [ ] Primary file has at least 3 sections with substantive content
- [ ] No sections contain ONLY placeholder/template text
- [ ] README.md has real description (not template boilerplate)
- [ ] At least one domain-specific insight encoded (not generic)

---

## Anti-Patterns

1. **Robotic Q&A** — Don't be a questionnaire. Be conversational. Reference previous answers. Connect dots between sections.
2. **Overwriting creator edits** — If creator has already manually edited a section, don't overwrite. Ask: "This section has content. Enhance, replace, or skip?"
3. **Generic fill** — If a section reads like any AI could write it, push: "What's YOUR specific approach here? What would surprise someone reading this?"
4. **Section overload** — Don't try to fill everything in one session. After 5-6 sections, offer: "We covered the core. Want to continue or save progress and come back?"
5. **Ignoring domain-map** — If domain-map.md exists, USE it. Don't re-ask questions already answered there.
6. **Thin sections without flagging** — Never leave a <50 word section without telling the creator it's thin. Section quality signals are mandatory.
7. **Skipping acceptance_criteria** — Must-have capture is NOT optional. Without acceptance criteria, /validate has nothing goal-backward to check.
8. **Forgetting persona mid-fill** — Re-read creator.yaml persona BEFORE each major section. A developer gets different questions than a marketer, even for the same section.

## Compact Instructions

When context is compressed, preserve:
- Target product slug, type, current phase (scaffold/content)
- `fill_progress.last_completed_section` and `fill_progress.sections_filled`
- Active extraction mode (`fill_config.extraction_mode`)
- Sparring state: `sparring.sections_challenged`, `sparring.skipped`
- Scout availability (`fill_config.scout_available`)
- Any blocking issues found during mid-fill quality signals
- Next section to fill (resume from `last_completed_section + 1`)
