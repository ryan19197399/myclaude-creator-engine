# Product Spec: Systems

## Definition

Systems are meta-products that combine multiple product types into cohesive, integrated
solutions. A system is the highest-complexity product type — it is not a collection of
parts but a unified whole with routing, shared state, and emergent capability greater
than any single component.

CE-D6: Systems are the premium tier. The Creator Engine itself is a system-type product.

A system is NOT:
- A squad (squads coordinate agents; systems coordinate any product types)
- A bundle (bundles are collections; systems have routing and integration logic)
- Just a folder with multiple products

A system IS:
- An integrated solution with explicit component interaction
- A product with its own routing layer and shared knowledge base
- Greater-than-the-sum-of-parts through deliberate composition

## Required Sections in SYSTEM.md

### 1. System Name, Purpose, and Composition

```markdown
# System Name

**Purpose:** One sentence — what this system achieves as a whole
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Components:** [list: 2 skills + 1 agent + 1 workflow, etc.]
**Entry Point:** How a user starts using this system
**Complexity:** [OPERATIONAL | COGNITIVE | HYBRID]
```

### 2. Architecture Overview

How the components fit together:
- Which components exist and what they each do
- How components interact with each other
- What data flows between components
- The routing layer that coordinates everything

Visual representation strongly recommended:

```markdown
## Architecture

[User Input]
     │
     ▼
[Routing Layer] ─── intent: "analyze" ──► [analysis-skill]
     │                                         │
     └── intent: "generate" ──► [generator-agent]
                                               │
                                               ▼
                               [shared knowledge base]
                                               │
                                               ▼
                               [output-workflow] ──► [Final Output]
```

### 3. Component Inventory

Every component with its role, type, and location:

```markdown
## Components

| Name | Type | Location | Purpose |
|------|------|----------|---------|
| analysis-skill | Skill | skills/analysis/ | Decomposes input |
| generator-agent | Agent | agents/generator.md | Creates outputs |
| output-workflow | Workflow | workflows/output/ | Formats and delivers |
```

### 4. Routing Logic

How the system decides which component handles which input:

```markdown
## Routing

The system entry point routes requests based on intent:
- Intent: analyze → analysis-skill
- Intent: generate → generator-agent (uses analysis output)
- Intent: both → analysis-skill → generator-agent (sequential)
```

### 5. Shared Knowledge Base

What all components share:
- Files in `references/` that multiple components consume
- Common terminology and definitions
- Shared state and how it's managed

### 6. User Journey

The primary paths a user takes through the system:
- Entry point (how they invoke the system)
- Common paths (the 3-5 most frequent usage patterns)
- Edge case paths (what happens in exceptional scenarios)

### 7. Configuration

How to configure the system for specific contexts:
- What can be customized
- How to enable/disable components
- Integration with other MyClaude products

## manifest.yaml Format

```yaml
# manifest.yaml — auto-read by system routing
system:
  name: "system-name"
  version: "1.0.0"
  entry_point: "SYSTEM.md"

components:
  skills:
    - name: "skill-name"
      path: "skills/skill-name/"
      mcs_level: 2
      handles: ["intent-1", "intent-2"]

  agents:
    - name: "agent-name"
      path: "agents/agent-name.md"
      mcs_level: 2
      handles: ["intent-3"]

  workflows:
    - name: "workflow-name"
      path: "workflows/workflow-name/"
      mcs_level: 1
      triggers: ["completion-of-agent-name"]

  shared_references:
    - "references/shared-knowledge.md"

integration:
  routing: "config/routing.yaml"
  knowledge_base: "references/"
```

## Anti-Patterns for Systems

### Structural
- **Bundle masquerading as system:** Folder containing multiple products but no routing, no shared knowledge, no integration logic. A system has emergent capability; a bundle is just packaging.
- **Broken component references:** `manifest.yaml` lists `skills/my-skill/` but the directory doesn't exist. All component references must resolve.
- **Missing manifest:** System without `config/manifest.yaml`. The system's components are implicit instead of explicit.

### Content
- **Components that don't interact:** Each component is self-contained and none share context, state, or outputs. If they don't interact, it's a bundle, not a system.
- **Routing logic in prose only:** "Use the analysis skill when you want analysis" — routing must be declarative (routing.yaml) not just described in English.
- **No entry point definition:** SYSTEM.md doesn't specify how a user invokes the system. Buyers can't figure out where to start.

### Quality
- **Components not individually usable:** All components are so tightly coupled they only work inside the system. MCS-3 requires composable components.
- **No integration tests:** System validated by checking each component independently. Integration tests must verify components work together.

## Discovery Questions (from §7)

When creating a system, answer these before scaffolding:

1. What is the system's overarching purpose? (what does the whole achieve that parts cannot)
2. What product types does it combine? (skills + agents + workflows? what's the right mix)
3. How do the components interact? (routing, handoffs, shared state, sequential vs. parallel)
4. What is the user entry point? (what does a user say/do to activate the system)
5. Can components be used independently or only as a system? (composability decision)
6. What is the shared knowledge base? (what context all components need)
7. What are the 3-5 most common user paths through the system?
