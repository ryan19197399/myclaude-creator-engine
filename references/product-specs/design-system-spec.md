# Product Spec: Design Systems

## Definition

Design Systems are token sets, component specifications, brand kits, and design rules
for Claude Code projects. They enable consistent visual implementation by encoding
design decisions as structured, machine-readable tokens that Claude Code can reference
when building UI.

A design system is NOT:
- A Figma file export (this is a code-first, text-based format)
- A CSS framework (though it can export to Tailwind or CSS variables)
- A collection of UI screenshots

A design system IS:
- A structured set of design tokens (color, type, spacing, shadows, motion)
- A specification that Claude Code can read and apply consistently
- An exportable design contract between design and implementation

## Required Sections in DESIGN-SYSTEM.md

### 1. Design System Name and Philosophy

```markdown
# Design System Name

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Philosophy:** One to two sentences describing the design values (e.g., "minimal, functional,
dark-first; no decoration that doesn't serve function")
**Target Platforms:** [web | mobile | both]
**Base Unit:** [4px | 8px | other] (the fundamental spacing unit)
```

### 2. Token Architecture

How the tokens are organized and named:
- Naming convention (semantic vs. scale-based)
- Token hierarchy (primitive → semantic → component)
- Color space used (OKLCH recommended for perceptual uniformity, HSL, or hex)

### 3. Color System

The color token structure with at minimum:
- Brand colors (primary, secondary, accent)
- Semantic colors (surface, on-surface, border, overlay)
- Status colors (success, warning, error, info)
- Full light/dark mode support OR explicit single-mode declaration

### 4. Typography Scale

- Font family stack (with fallbacks)
- Type scale steps (xs through 4xl or equivalent)
- Line height recommendations per scale step
- Font weight options

### 5. Spacing Scale

- Base unit
- Scale multipliers (1×, 1.5×, 2×, 3×, 4×, 6×, 8×, etc.)
- Named steps (xs, sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl, etc.)

### 6. Export Instructions

How to apply the tokens in a project:
- Which export file to use for which platform
- Installation steps
- How to reference tokens in code

---

## Token Format Standards

### colors.yaml

```yaml
# Colors use OKLCH for perceptual uniformity
# Format: oklch(lightness chroma hue)
colors:
  primitive:
    brand-500: "oklch(55% 0.22 250)"
    brand-600: "oklch(48% 0.22 250)"
  semantic:
    primary: "$colors.primitive.brand-500"
    primary-hover: "$colors.primitive.brand-600"
    surface: "oklch(98% 0 0)"
    on-surface: "oklch(15% 0 0)"
    border: "oklch(88% 0 0)"
  status:
    success: "oklch(60% 0.18 145)"
    warning: "oklch(72% 0.18 85)"
    error: "oklch(55% 0.22 20)"
    info: "oklch(62% 0.18 230)"
```

### typography.yaml

```yaml
typography:
  families:
    sans: "'Inter', 'system-ui', sans-serif"
    mono: "'JetBrains Mono', 'Consolas', monospace"
  scale:
    xs:   { size: "0.75rem",  lineHeight: "1rem" }
    sm:   { size: "0.875rem", lineHeight: "1.25rem" }
    base: { size: "1rem",     lineHeight: "1.5rem" }
    lg:   { size: "1.125rem", lineHeight: "1.75rem" }
    xl:   { size: "1.25rem",  lineHeight: "1.75rem" }
    2xl:  { size: "1.5rem",   lineHeight: "2rem" }
    3xl:  { size: "1.875rem", lineHeight: "2.25rem" }
    4xl:  { size: "2.25rem",  lineHeight: "2.5rem" }
  weights:
    normal: 400
    medium: 500
    semibold: 600
    bold: 700
```

## Anti-Patterns for Design Systems

### Structural
- **Raw values without semantic layer:** Only providing `brand-blue-500: "#3B82F6"` without `primary: "$brand-blue-500"`. Semantic tokens are what make a design system adaptable.
- **Export files as placeholder:** `tailwind.config.js` that only has `// TODO: add tokens`. Broken exports make the product non-functional.
- **Missing typography scale:** Only providing colors. Typography scale is mandatory — half the visual language is type.

### Content
- **Inconsistent naming:** Some tokens use `camelCase`, others use `kebab-case`, others use underscores. Pick one convention and apply it everywhere.
- **No light/dark specification:** Color tokens that work only in one mode without declaring which mode. Buyers need to know what they're getting.
- **Hardcoded hex without color space strategy:** Large token sets in hex without any perceptual consistency. OKLCH or HSL prevents color math problems.

### Quality
- **No usage examples:** Token library exists but no examples show how to use it in practice. Buyers can't evaluate fit.
- **Component specs without states:** Button component defined only for default state. All interactive components have at minimum 4 states (default, hover, focus, disabled).

## Discovery Questions (from §7)

When creating a design system, answer these before scaffolding:

1. What brand identity? (colors, typography personality, visual weight)
2. What platforms? (web only, mobile, both)
3. What export formats are needed? (Tailwind, CSS variables, DTCG, other)
4. How deep is the component library? (tokens only, tokens + basic components, full library)
5. Light mode only, dark mode only, or both?
6. What is the base unit for spacing? (4px, 8px, or other)
7. Does this need theming support? (multiple color themes from same token set)
