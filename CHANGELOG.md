# Changelog

All notable changes to the MyClaude Studio Engine.

## [3.0.0] — 2026-04-10

### Added
- **Intent topology** — products declare cognitive intent (advisory, procedural, generative, analytical, creative) that shapes validation criteria and structural expectations
- **10 validation stages** (was 7+1) — Stage 0: Intent Coherence, Stage 1: Structural, Stage 2: Integrity, Stage 3-5: DNA Tiers 1-3, Stage 6: CLI Preflight, Stage 7: Anti-Commodity, Stage 8: Value Intelligence, Stage 9: Voice Coherence
- **Voice coherence validation** (Stage 9) — detects persona leakage, tone inconsistency, register drift across product sections
- **Intent coherence validation** (Stage 0) — verifies the product delivers what the creator set out to build
- **Fill protocol reference** — structured content-filling guide loaded on-demand by `/fill`
- **Onboard protocol reference** — extended onboarding flow with 8 persona adaptation paths
- **GitHub issue templates** — migrated from markdown to YAML forms (bug report, feature request, friction report)

- **First-time experience** — welcome frame, auto-onboard, personalized next step by profile type
- **Quick mode** — `--quick` flag for experienced creators (auto-triggers with 5+ products)
- `/scout` skill — domain research before building (gap analysis, marketplace scan, recommendations)
- `/think` skill — brainstorm and evaluate before committing

- `/aegis` skill — security audit (STRIDE, vulnerability detection, compliance)

### Changed
